# RESTful_CRUD_API

It doesn't matter if its comic book information, movie ratings, sports scores, or weather reports. All that matters is that you write an application that can create, read, update, and delete data from the database whenever JSON messages get received.

## To start:

- Design the database tables
- Write CRUD queries using raw SQL or with an ORM such as GORM
- Create an HTTP server and HTTP handlers for each CRUD operation using the correct status codes and methods for requests and responses
  
### Additional Stuff:

- Add support for API keys
- Track API usage per key and implement quotas
- Add a fictional billing system to the API
- Set a different price for each CRUD operation
- Generate revenue reports and usage reports
- Generate invoices with a detailed breakdown of API usage per key

### Potential packages:

- SQL database
- go-sqlite3
- Http
- JSON encoding
